The aim is to get the frog safely across the road as many times as possible, going back and forth through the traffic lanes.
Move the frog using the cursor keys.  One key press will move the frog one grid block in that direction.
After crossing the road 5 times, a new level is reached.  Levels increase in difficulty through vehicle speed and frequency.
The player will lose a life if he gets run over by a vehicle and will gain one life upon reaching every 5th level.
The code builds most easily on Visual Studio .NET 2003 on Windows XP.
