The aim of this game is to manoeuvre a ball around a 3D world of platforms made up of blocks.  There are several ways of controlling the ball:
 - keyboard (using the arrow keys to tilt the world)
 - mouse (left-click and drag the ball in the direction required)
 - Nintendo Wii remote (tilt the remote and the world will tilt corresponding to the direction of the remote)

To use the Nintendo Wii remote, it must be connected to the machine via Bluetooth.  On Windows machine, the Bluetooth driver BlueSoleil works most successfully, allowing a bluetooth device to be connected to the machine.  Once connected, the game can be started and the remote used to complete the levels.

Some extra functionality using keyboard and mouse buttons are described below.  Although some of them were used primarily for testing purposes, they were kept in to allow the user to have a better view of the world.

Other functionality:
 - clicking the mouse left and right button causes the camera to change direction during the game.  This allows you to view the world from other angles and enables more intuitive navigation around the world.  Likewise, the 'q' and 'w' keyboard buttons also change the camera angle.
 - the space bar on the keyboard can be used to bring the ball to a complete stop.
 - the keyboard button 't' can be used to switch between play mode and test mode.  In test mode, the user can view the world using the mouse.  Dragging the mouse rotates the world, while the scroll button zooms in and out.
