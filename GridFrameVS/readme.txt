Aim of the Game
===============
The aim of this game is to manoeuvre a ball around a 3D world of platforms made up of blocks.  There are several ways of controlling the ball:
 - keyboard (using the arrow keys to tilt the world)
 - mouse (left-click and drag the ball in the direction required)
 - Nintendo Wii remote (tilt the remote and the world will tilt corresponding to the direction of the remote)



To use the Nintendo Wii remote, it must be connected to the machine via Bluetooth.  On Windows machine, the Bluetooth driver BlueSoleil works most successfully, allowing a Bluetooth device to be connected to the machine.  Once connected, the game can be started and the remote used to complete the levels.



Some extra functionality using keyboard and mouse buttons are described below.  Although some of them were used primarily for testing purposes, they were kept in to allow the user to have a better view of the world.
